[Flex] Phase 2 Project

Dog Encyclopedia

There are many breeds of dogs and I made a page so you can find out what the name is and what they look like.
Also included the lifespan of the breed of dog so as to know if they are old or not.

To get the file running:
Step 1: Open terminal
Step 2: Run npm install
Step 3: Run npm install react-router-dom@5
Step 4: Run npm start

On a separate terminal:
Step 1: Run npm install -g json-server
Step 2: Run json-server --watch db.json

This will get the web page running with the JSON files included.
